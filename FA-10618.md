As we are always using AXSID (we were not using it only for 'Wasps' skin), removed
- Removed `useAXSID` and `allowEditEmailPromos` flags from skin config
- Removed unnecessary checks of `useAXSID` flag
- Removed code needed only when `useAXSID` flag was off
- Refactored date of birth input and read only fields displaying logic in personal details form

Clarification of not straigtforward deletions
> `checkExistingSession` was only used in `App.js`
